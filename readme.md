## *G-Standards* is an organized collection of methods related to Garry's Mod.
#### Standards help us share and reference methods.<br>
Standards can:<br>
- Describe a method to create vehicle suspensions or tune ACF gearboxes.
- Help us understand how to use tools such as Expression2 or Prop2Mesh.
- Be used to share rules for an event, so you can later easily reference and change them.
- Be tested and improved by anyone.

And many more things can be done with *G-Standards*.

*G-Standards* are numerically sorted, every standard has their unique index and can be found in this repository.
For example, if you want to share "Jackpody's Suspension" with someone, you can simply tell them it is standardized under <b>G112221</b>.

This collection accepts any methods in Garry's Mod building!<br>
Any method as complicated as building a 16-bit adder circuit with gates, and, as easy as making a prop base, are valid.<br>
