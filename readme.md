## *Avtomat Standards* is an organized collection of methods related to Garry's Mod.
Standards help us share and reference methods and rules.<br>
Standards can:<br>
- Describe a method to create vehicle suspensions or tune ACF gearboxes.
- Help us understand how to use tools such as Expression2 or Prop2Mesh.
- Be used to share rules for an event, so you can later easily reference and change them.
- Be tested and improved by anyone.

And many more things can be done with *Avtomat Standards*.

This collection accepts any methods in Garry's Mod building!<br>
Any method as complicated as building a 16-bit adder circuit with gates, and, as easy as making a prop base, are valid.<br>
