### This standard defines what features a vehicle can or cannot have to take part in Avtomat events.

#### 1. Artificial forces.
- 1.1. Artificial forces can only apply rotational force on the wheels of a vehicle.
- 1.2. Do not use any type of downforce - E2 applyForce or Fin spoilers are not allowed.
- 1.3. A vehicle may be propelled by anything (E2, prop engines, ACF).

#### 2. Weight.
- 2.1. A vehicle must have a fixed weight. Intentionally variable weight systems are not allowed.
- 2.2. The weight of a vehicle must be realistic. This is in a way subjective, but common sense applies - do not make your truck weigh 200kg.

#### 3. Engine.
- 3.1. Only one physical engine is allowed in a vehicle, no exceptions. Another small engine to simulate a turbo is also not allowed.
- 3.2. Engine's power and size must be realistic, common sense applies. Do not put a 3.0 V12 into a Twingo.
- 3.3. E2 engines don't have a physical model, but keep the applied forces in a range where the acceleration and top speed of a car is realistic.

#### 4. Air drag.
- 4.1. No air drag modifications can be made to any part of the car.

#### 5. Body work.
- 5.1. A car must be recognisable as a car and not just a chassis.
- 5.2. ATV class vehicles (bikes, buggies, etc) can have little to no bodywork, as that is the realistic design.
- 5.3. Using downloaded models such as TDM and using them as hologram bodies for your vehicle is not allowed.
- 5.4. A prop body converted to holograms is allowed.
- 5.5. Using models from HL2 and other source games (The Green ZAZ, CSS Corolla, etc.) is allowed as long as you extensively modify them.
