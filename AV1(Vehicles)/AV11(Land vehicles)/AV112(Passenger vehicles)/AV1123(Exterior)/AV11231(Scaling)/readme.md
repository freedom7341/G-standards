#### EXTERIOR VEHICLE SCALING

Scale gives trucks their menacing feel and proportions give cars their shape.
Both are equally important on any vehicle.
While it seems like an easy thing to take care of, it becomes a real issue when you step back and realize the roof is just a little too tall.

First thing when starting to build a wheeled vehicle is how big are the wheels and in what kind of relation are the wheels with the rest of the body.
E.g on modern sports cars the wheels are tucked in with the body and the whole car sits very low to the ground.
Older trucks on the other hand tend to sit very high with the whole underside visible in plain sight.

There is a lot of different ways to achieve proper proportions and here we will explore a few of them.

#### 1. Reference images.
By using the addon called "Blueprint tool" we can place and scale an image on top of which we can lay down our props in their estimated proper position.
Using the blueprint tool might be confusing to newcommers so it is recommended to seek tips and tutorials on the addon's workshop site.

#### 2. Reference holograms.
Using Expression 2 to create a hologram of our car then laying props on top of the holo.
E.g we want to build a prop built Camaro, we would find a vehicle addon that has an acceptible Camaro model and use that prop to create an e2 holo of it.

We would install something like TDM cars chevrolet pack, then browse addon models and copy the car model into an e2 chip which will create a holo with that model.

Once we've layed out our shape with props over the hologram, we would delete the e2 that creates the holo and keep the props.


#### 3. Eyeballing it.
Simply by looking at a lot of pictures, the user would lay out the props by looking at specific parts of the car, 
then determining the scale of each part relative to other parts.

E.g I know a bus wheel well is around the same width as the front door on that same bus.


#### 4. Recommended sizes and dimensions.
Standard small car wheel - 25 unit wheel.<br>
Standard modern sports car wheel - 30 unit wheel.<br>
Truck wheels - 30-50 unit wheels.<br>

Sports car - not taller than a person, at least 6 inches shorter.<br>
Hatchback - still a little shorter than a person, at least 2 inches shorter.<br>
Minivan - about as tall as a person.<br>
Van - a little taller, depending on what kind of van.<br>
Truck - quite a lot taller than a person, the windshield should start up higher than a person..<br>

#### Conclusion.
3rd option is always recommended to utilise no matter what method you use. When adding spoilers to cars you don't want them to be too small or too big (depends entirely on what kinda spoiler).
