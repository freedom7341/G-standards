This standard provides a method for creating hydraulic suspension which is unique in a way where hydraulics are attached from the wheel to their intended position,
making a theoretical hydraulic length 0. This type of suspension eliminates the common flaw of wheels popping out of their position if they hit a big bump.

#### 1. Replicate steps 1-9 from AV112221(Jackpody).
Do everything as you would when making suspension until you have to make the hydraulics.

#### 2. Create hydraulics.
Instead of following the step 10 from AV112221(Jackpody) and put the hydraulic points above wheels, you must:
1. Create point 1 on the mass center of a wheel.
2. Create a point 2 on the mass center of a wheel and attach it to the baseplate.
3. Create a hydraulic connection.

#### 3. Continue with steps 11-12 from AV112221(Jackpody).
Preferably, use another plate where you put your hydraulic controllers.
Make sure hydraulic length is always set to 0, you can only change the "Constant" and "Damping" of controllers.
