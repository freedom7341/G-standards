### If you feel like there is something that is missing in the given standards, we are open to contributions from anyone!

### If you want to introduce a new standard:

#### 1. Include an explanation of your standard.
Make sure to include some kind of an explanation on what the reader is about to follow, otherwise the steps may seem confusing out of context.

#### 2. Standards must be written in a step-by-step style with numbering.
Example of a bad standard:<br>
*To make a setang, simply get this E2 (E2 code) and spawn a gate, then ballsocket your wheels to the setang and ballsocket setang to wheels.*

Example of a good standard:<br>
*1. Create an E2 gate by using this E2 code (E2 code).*<br>
*2. Wire the "Baseplate:entity" of E2 to your baseplate.*<br>
*3. Make sure your wheels, baseplate and E2 are aligned to the world.*<br>
*4. Configure the "ballsocket-advanced" tool to have these values: (values).*<br>
*5. ...*<br>

#### 3. Post your standard as a text file in "Issues", you can also include questions and nuances in the post.
We do not take pull requests for new standards, because classification and naming is done by owners of this repository to prevent mistakes from happening.

### If you want to correct a mistake in an existing standard, you can create a pull-request or post an edited text file in issues, referencing the number and name of the standard.

### Don't hesitate to contact one of the owners directly if you have questions.
