## If you feel like there is something that is missing in the given standards, feel free to define a new standard, we are open to contributions from anyone!
## You can contribute by creating a pull request or messaging "Zengit" on Steam.

## There are certain rules you must follow to contribute:

### 1. Avtomat standards begin with AV, sub-groups are separated by the "-" symbol.
An example of how standards can be organized:
* AV-1 (Transportation)
  * AV-1-1 (Cars)
    * AV-1-1-1 (Engines)
     * AV-1-1-2 (Steering)
     * AV-1-1-X
  * AV-1-2 (Tanks)
  * AV-X-X
* AV-X
  
### 2. There must be one .md file in every sub-directory explaining the principles of how to do a certain thing.
For example if you want to share your knowledge on how to build light vehicle bodies with props, you would put your description in:
 *AV-1 (Transportation)
  *AV-1-1 (Cars)
   *AV-1-1-X (Body)
    *AV-1-1-X.md
Where you would describe some fundamental steps on how to build a vehicle body.

### 3. Standards must be written in a step-by-step style.
