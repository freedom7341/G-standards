### If you feel like there is something that is missing in the given standards, feel free to define a new standard, we are open to contributions from anyone!
#### You can contribute by creating a pull request or messaging "Zengit" on Steam.
#### You can also contribute by correcting spelling mistakes, grammar and nuances of other people's standards, no contribution is useless.

### There are certain rules you must follow to contribute:

#### 1. Avtomat standards begin with AV, sub-groups are separated by the "-" symbol.
An example of how standards can be organized:
* AV-1 (Transportation)
  * AV-1-1 (Cars)
    * AV-1-1-1 (Engines)
    * AV-1-1-2 (Steering)
    * AV-1-1-X
  * AV-1-2 (Tanks)
  * AV-X-X
* AV-X
  
#### 2. There must be one .md file in every sub-directory explaining the principles of how to do a certain thing.
For example if you want to share your knowledge on how to build light vehicle bodies with props, you would put your description in:
 * AV-1 (Transportation)
   * AV-1-1 (Cars)
     * AV-1-1-X (Body)
       * AV-1-1-X.md

Where you would describe some fundamental steps on how to build a vehicle body.

#### 3. Include an explanation of your standard.
Make sure to include some kind of an explanation on what the reader is about to follow, otherwise the steps may seem confusing out of context.

#### 4. Standards must be written in a step-by-step style with numbering.
Example of a bad standard:<br>
*To make a setang, simply get this E2 (E2 code) and spawn a gate, then ballsocket your wheels to the setang and ballsocket setang to wheels.*

Example of a good standard:<br>
*1. Create an E2 gate by using this E2 code (E2 code).*<br>
*2. Wire the "Baseplate:entity" of E2 to your baseplate.*<br>
*3. Make sure your wheels, baseplate and E2 are aligned to the world.*<br>
*4. Configure the "ballsocket-advanced" tool to have these values: (values).*<br>
*5. ...*<br>

#### 5. Split explanations into smaller directories.
Try not to write 100 lines of text in one standard if otherwise impossible. Splitting up your ideas and explanations will make it easier to read and reference a standard for others.
