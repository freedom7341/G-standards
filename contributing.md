## If you feel like there is something that is missing in the given standards, we are open to contributions from anyone!

### If you want to correct a mistake in an existing standard:
You can create a pull-request or post an edited text file in issues, referencing the number and name of the standard.
Don't hesitate to contact one of the owners directly if you have questions.

### If you want to introduce a new standard:

#### 1. Include an explanation of your standard.
Make sure to include some kind of an explanation on what the reader is about to follow, otherwise the steps may seem confusing out of context.

#### 2. Standards must be written in a step-by-step style with numbering.
Explain what you will do in a step shortly, then explain the details separately.

##### Bad example:<br>
*To make a setang, simply get this E2 (E2 code) and spawn a gate, then ballsocket your wheels to the setang and ballsocket setang to wheels.*
##### Good example:<br>
*1. Setup the E2.*<br>
*Select your E2 tool and paste this code inside, then spawn it.*<br><br>
*2. Wire the E2 to baseplate.*<br>
*Select your "Wire" tool and select "Base[Entity]" on the E2, then click on the baseplate.*<br><br>
*3. Make sure your wheels, baseplate and E2 are aligned to the world.*<br><br>
*4. Configure the "ballsocket-advanced" tool.*<br>
*Your ballsocket-advanced tool should have these values:*<br>
*(values)*<br><br>
*5. ...*<br><br>
In fact, these rules are written in such a style.

#### 3. The language must be appropriate.
Refrain from using vulgar words or out-of-context comments. Of course not everyone is a great writer, so a bit of informality is acceptable.

#### 4. Post your standard as a text file in "Issues", you can also include questions and nuances in the post.
We do not take pull requests for new standards, because classification and naming is done by owners of this repository to prevent mistakes from happening.
